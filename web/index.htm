<h1>GeLab - genetic experiment labeler</h1>
<h2>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/fidli/gelab">GitHub</a> powered with <a href="https://github.com/fidli/baselib">baselib</a></h2>
<h2>Latest release: ALPHA</h2>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>GeLab is genetic experiment labeler. Its aim is to fully or partially automatize uncreative labeling routines after the experiment is done.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>Usage: build.exe inputfile [-b num_of_blocks] [-m order "text"] [-l list beginning_symbol_index -n total_column_count] [-i list] [-IM] outputfile

 inputfile
  - original TIFF file from experiment

 -b num_of_blocks
  - valid range [1, 50]
  - how many experiments are in inputfile - default: 1

 -m order "text"
  - valid 'order' range [1, 255]
  - find mark on place 'order' and put 'text' next to it, mark wont be added, if this is not set

 -l list beginning_symbol_index
  - valid 'beginning_symbol_range' range [1, 50]
  - 'list' are ASCII characters (one letter) labeling experiment columns in cycle starting at 'beginning_symbol_index', requires -n to be set too, columns wont be marked if this is not set

 -n total_column_count
  - valid range [1, 255]
  - sets the total column count that the experiment has

 -i list
  - which blocks in the experiment to output, indexes separated by comma - default: outputs all
  - valid 'index' range [1, 50]

 -I
  - do not invert colors

 -M
  - crop and outline experiment manually. This option will pop up a window that requires interaction

 outputfile
  - where to save the ouput to</pre>
